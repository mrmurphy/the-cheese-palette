The real source for a real site for a real company selling real products, and it's written almost completely in Elm.

This source is up here for community reference, it's not really intended that anyone try to pull it down and run it locally, just look through it.

Also, this was my first real project in Elm, and I did a lot of learning while making it. The messy state of some of the code attests to that.
